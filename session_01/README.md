## My first **GitHub Star and Fork**

## My first **GitHub Clone and Download**

## **To use Git you need to install git in your computer**

## My first **GitHub Clone through terminal/command prompt**
Once you fork and make an own copy of the project you can clone it. To clone a project you have to copy the project URL as I have shown in the above sample screenshot. Then you have to open a terminal window (for mac users) / command promt(for windows users).

After that as the first step your have to navigate in to the directory where you planing to store your project related stuff.

```
cd project_directory
git clone **project URL which you copied from github project**

```


## My first **GitHub Commit**
 
## My first **GitHub Push**
